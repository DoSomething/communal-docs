# Contributing

We keep our [code open-source at DoSomething.org](https://github.com/dosomething) when possible.

## Style Guide

Most of our major projects use StyleCI to lint each commit to the repo.

### Imports

We prefer to sort import statements by ascending line length, e.g.:
```
import React from 'react';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

import Query from '../../../../Query';
import ReferralsListItem from './ReferralsListItem';
import SectionHeader from '../../../../utilities/SectionHeader/SectionHeader';

```

## Assets

### SVG

When adding a SVG to the codebase, be sure to it SVGs through this optimizer: https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg.

It will help strip out a bunch of unnecessary junk that Adobe Illustrator, Sketch (insert your favorite vector program), etc add to the code. The default settings are usually just fine and youâ€™ll usually see around like a 50% drop in file size for most SVGs!

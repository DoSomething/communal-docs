# Runscope
Runscope Is a service that allows us to run automated API tests to evaluate the uptime, performance and correctness of an API.

## Users
Some tests require a valid user to validate the API responses. Here's a list of test users being used in our apps:

| App | NorthstarId | role |
| -- | -- | -- |
Blink | `5af9a42fa0bfad6b4a7c67f8` | user
